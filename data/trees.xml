There are hundreds of baby Chestnuts below them, so that, despite the die back of the main branches, all these trees are still vigorous.</text>

        <tag>Veteran</tag>
        <text>In Bishops Knoll Wood, Bramble Lane, Stoke Bishop. Girth 710cm. Age 150 years. This species was first introduced into the UK from its tiny natural outpost on the Monterey Peninsula in Californian in 1839. It proved to have the fastest rate of growth of any species. This colossal specimen, still surrounded by its Victorian ironwork, cannot have been planted earlier than 1860. It is one of the parents of Cupressus leylandii, so commonly, and rashly, planted as screening today.</text>

        <text>Bishops Knoll Wood, Bramble Lane Stoke Bishop. Girth 700cm. Aged 700 years. This massive tree may have been a bundle planting, as its various trunks do not appear to originate from a pollard cut. It is mysterious because its presence is disguised by the growth of young ash trees around it, and, despite its huge size, it is not easy to find.</text>

        <text>Bishops Knoll wood, Bramble Lane Stoke Bishop. Girth 690cm. Age 700 years old. This is the largest of a line of squat oak pollards which were planted just above the floodplain of the river Avon as part of the wood-pasture of the old Sneyd Park estate. Sixty years ago they were all still fine tall trees, but are now reduced to hulks, dominated by young ash trees. Some are still vigorous; others have collapsed completely. Several are on private land.</text>

This fine leaning veteran pollard is technically in private land, but easily seen. The whole area of Sneyd Park was originally woodland pasture, and there are a large number of veteran oaks which have survived, many now in private gardens.</text>

        <text>Brislington Brook. Girth 675cm. Age 250 years. London Planes grow very rapidly, and this vast specimen was probably associated with Brislington House. It now fills the valley of the brook, and is hollow. It was in danger of being ruined by fires built inside its hollow trunk, a common fate of veteran trees, but was recently saved by being bricked up. The species came to Britain in 1690, and is still being widely planted.</text>

        <text>York Place, Clifton in the grounds of Manor Hall. Girth 625cm. Age 450. Much the oldest and largest Horse Chestnut in the city, this vigorous multi-trunked maiden tree has survived the building of Manor Hall in the 1960s which left it isolated twenty feet above the road that had been driven past it. From a distance it looks like an ordinary tree, but its base is well below the level of York Place. Close up it is astonishing.</text>

        <text>Blaise estate. Girth 600cm. Age 150. This is the second large tree close to the lowest pond on the Trym. When the seeds arrived from California, in 1855, at the Veitch nursery in Exeter, everyone who was anyone bought a tree. The Smythes of Ashton Court bought an avenue. Thus almost every tree in Bristol is roughly the same Age, and difference in girth reflect their habitat. Unfortunately, a number have died or are dying, which, as they can live for 5000 years, is disturbing. There is a grove of them in Ashton Hill Plantation, a stunning sight.</text>

Until five years ago they were towering trees, but fears that they might collapse and cause damage, led to all three being cut down to about twenty feet in height. Their vast girth is unaltered, and all three are putting out new shoots. Whereas once they dominated, now they have to be looked for. Includes trees 20 &amp; 21.</text>

This is the largest of a number of the oaks which would normally have been felled at an Age of about 150 years if the price was right. But demand for timber fell sharply in the 19th century with the invention of cheap steel so that a large number of veteran trees remain.</text>

The Common Lime was the commonest tree for formal avenues in the 18th century, and there are the remnants of a double avenue on one side of the carriage drive and a single one on the other, almost certainly planted when the house was built by Vanbrugh in 1720. This is the oldest lime avenue in the city. The longest, planted in 1860, leads up to what is now Redland High School, at ST584 745. The trees typically have dense masses of growth both around the base of the trunk and in the middle of the tree as they are clones. The individual trees in the avenue have suffered a variety of different fates down the years, and are very hard to measure accurately.</text>

        <text>This small tree grows on the slope of Brandon Hill. It was planted in 1973 as part of plant a tree year, and already has a girth of 300cm. a growth rate of almost 8 cm a year, three times that of most trees. It shows what the huge trees that dominate Bristol's skyline today would have looked like in around 1900 to their proud owners.</text>

        <text>This tree grows in Greville Smythe Park and has a girth of 400cm. so was probably planted around 1950. At about 20metres it, most unusually splits into three separate trunks.</text>
