        This site aims to provide an interactive guide to the trees in Bristol. It uses data from multiple sources, including
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://bristoltreeforum.org/">Bristol Tree Forum</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://friendsofstandrewspark.ning.com/">Friends of St Andrews Park</a></li>
            <li>Bristol City Council.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

      There are several ways to locate a tree:
      <ul>
          <li>Select a Collection of trees to view a map of all trees, then select an individual tree, either in the list or on the map to view details</li>
          <li>Select a Species to view a map of all trees of that species or dataon the species itself</li>
          <li>Use Search to search for a tree by collection, latin or common name, text in descriptions or proximity to a location.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
